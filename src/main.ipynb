        "3. **Domain-Specific Strategies:**\n",
        "\n",

        "### I. Feature Scaling\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature scaling** is a preprocessing technique used in machine learning to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. The primary goal of feature scaling is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the training process and that machine learning algorithms can work effectively with the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the main reasons why feature scaling is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Algorithm Sensitivity:** Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of input features. If the scales of features are significantly different, some algorithms may perform poorly or take much longer to converge.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Distance-Based Algorithms:** Algorithms that rely on distances or similarities between data points, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM), can be influenced by feature scales. Features with larger scales may dominate the distance calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Regularization:** Regularization techniques, like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, add penalty terms based on feature coefficients. Scaling ensures that all features are treated equally in the regularization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common methods for feature scaling include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization):** This method scales features to a specific range, typically [0, 1]. It's done using the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$X' = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Here, $X$ is the original feature value, $X_{min}$ is the minimum value of the feature, and $X_{max}$ is the maximum value of the feature.  \n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "2. **Standardization (Z-score Scaling):** This method scales features to have a mean (average) of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's done using the following formula:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$X' = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "   - $X$ is the original feature value, $\\mu$ is the mean of the feature, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the feature.  \n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "3. **Robust Scaling:** Robust scaling is a method that scales features to the interquartile range (IQR) and is less affected by outliers. It's calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$X' = \\frac{X - Q1}{Q3 - Q1}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "   - $X$ is the original feature value, $Q1$ is the first quartile (25th percentile), and $Q3$ is the third quartile (75th percentile) of the feature.  \n",
        "<br />\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "4. **Log Transformation:** In cases where data is highly skewed or has a heavy-tailed distribution, taking the logarithm of the feature values can help stabilize the variance and improve scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of scaling method depends on the characteristics of your data and the requirements of your machine learning algorithm. **Min-max scaling and standardization are the most commonly used techniques and work well for many datasets.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Scaling should be applied separately to each training and test set to prevent data leakage from the test set into the training set. Additionally, **some algorithms may not require feature scaling, particularly tree-based models.**"

        "\n",
        "1. **Biased Model Performance**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Models trained on imbalanced data tend to be biased towards the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class. This can result in misleading accuracy metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Misleading Accuracy**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - High overall accuracy can be misleading in imbalanced datasets. For example, if 95% of the data belongs to one class, a model that always predicts the majority class will have 95% accuracy but will fail to identify the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Poor Generalization**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Models trained on imbalanced data may not generalize well to new, unseen data, especially if the minority class is underrepresented.\n",

        "Some methods to handle imbalanced datasets:\n",
        "1. **Resampling Methods**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Oversampling: Increase the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating or generating synthetic samples (e.g., SMOTE).\n",
        " - Undersampling: Reduce the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix instead of accuracy to better assess model performance on imbalanced data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Algorithmic Approaches**:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Use algorithms that are designed to handle imbalanced data, such as decision trees, random forests, or ensemble methods.\n",

Sebaliknya, untuk kelas 0, Precision hanya mencapai 0.84, sementara Recall lebih rendah, yaitu 0.76. Rendahnya recall untuk kelas 0 menunjukkan bahwa model kesulitan menangkap semua sampel kelas minoritas, yang kemungkinan besar disebabkan oleh ketidakseimbangan data (kelas 1 jauh lebih banyak dibandingkan kelas 0)."
